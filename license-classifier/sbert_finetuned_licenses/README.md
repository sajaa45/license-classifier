    made by that Contributor. 3. Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Availability of Source
    Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
    Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include
    a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients
    of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
    customarily used for software exchange. 3.2. Modifications. The Modifications
    that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License.
    You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s)
    and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
    that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove
    or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution
    to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form
    that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients''
    rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
    alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result
    of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.5. Distribution
    of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
    Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
    choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
    are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in
    the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
    the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered
    by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
    offer. 3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
    with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
    of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 4. Versions of the License.
    4.1. New Versions. Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised
    and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
    a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other
    than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 4.2. Effect of
    New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes
    a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise
    made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute
    and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You
    may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
    under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
    steward. 4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want
    to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified
    version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
    to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
    this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms
    which differ from this License. 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS
    PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
    AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
    HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 6. TERMINATION. 6.1. This License and
    the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
    with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware
    of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
    the termination of this License shall survive. 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement
    claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
    claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software
    (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
    Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly
    to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is
    not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
    License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
    automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software
    against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement
    with Participant. 6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
    where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation
    of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted
    by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
    the amount or value of any payment or license. 6.4. In the event of termination
    under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly
    granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 7. LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
    SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
    ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
    TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE
    TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
    SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END
    USERS. The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as
    that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
    software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
    Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and
    supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
    rights in computer software under this License. 9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License
    represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
    of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
    only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original
    Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
    such jurisdiction''s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction
    and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the
    losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs
    and reasonable attorneys'' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that
    You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
    regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
    when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 10.
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors,
    each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
    Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
    basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability. NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
    LICENSE (CDDL) The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws
    of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation
    relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
    of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
    with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.'

    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 6.2. If
    You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
    against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
    against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant
    is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
    Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
    granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer

    CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,
    OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,
    BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS,
    LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
    OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
    TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE
    TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
    SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END
    USERS. The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as
    that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
    software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
    Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and
    supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
    rights in computer software under this License. 9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License
    represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
    of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
    only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original
    Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
    such jurisdiction''s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction
    and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the
    losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs
    and reasonable attorneys'' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that
    You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
    regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
    when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 10.
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors,
    each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
    Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
    basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability.'

    by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor. 3. Distribution
    Obligations. 3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or
    to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
    only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
    under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
    of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
    Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
    or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2 Availability of Source
    Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
    available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same
    media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism
    to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available
    via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
    (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
    months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
    available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source
    Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
    maintained by a third party. 3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause
    all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes
    You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
    a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
    from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
    of the Covered Code. 3.4 Intellectual Property Matters. (a) Third Party Claims.
    If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party''s intellectual
    property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
    under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
    Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making
    the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
    Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as
    described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
    all copies Contributor makes available thereafter. (b) Contributor API''s. If
    Contributor''s Modifications include an application programming interface and
    Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
    to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
    file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant
    to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor''s Modifications
    are Contributor''s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate
    the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
    to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then
    You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where
    a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
    Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
    in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
    Source Code where You describe recipients'' rights or ownership rights relating
    to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
    and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property
    claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such
    Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
    offer. 3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
    in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
    that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
    of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
    description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of Section 3.2.
    The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
    related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights
    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
    of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
    to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the
    rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under
    a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
    from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
    for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property
    claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such
    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7 Larger Works. You may
    create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by
    the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
    In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
    for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If
    it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
    extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
    description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this
    License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
    the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License.
    6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the "SNIA") may
    publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once
    Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You
    may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose
    to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
    published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the
    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3 Derivative Works.
    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
    in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
    License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Storage Networking
    Industry Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
    in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and
    (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
    differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
    Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
    THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
    CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
    (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
    PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
    UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. 8.1 This License and the rights granted
    hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
    and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of
    the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
    survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2 If
    You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer
    or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
    alleging that: o (a) such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
    Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
    notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
    reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
    Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
    Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty
    and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties
    or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to
    You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
    the 60 day notice period specified above. 8.3 If You assert a patent infringement
    claim against Participant alleging that such Participant''s Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such
    as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
    then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
    payment or license. 8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
    above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
    which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
    shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
    AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
    SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON
    FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
    IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
    SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
    APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial
    item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
    computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms
    are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
    48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
    acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. MISCELLANEOUS
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
    If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
    be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License
    shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
    law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
    to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and
    the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly
    or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
    to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
    on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute
    any admission of liability. 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may
    designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed"
    means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered
    Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
    by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A. 14. ACCEPTANCE. This
    License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code
    for any purpose. EXHIBIT A The SNIA Public License. The contents of this file

- source_sentence: 'CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive Preamble CERN
    has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and
    to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share
    and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2
    of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P
    (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN- OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and
    CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal). The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone
    is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only. Use of this Licence does not imply
    any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any
    involvement by CERN in their development. 1 Definitions 1.1 ''Licence'' means
    this CERN-OHL-P. 1.2 ''Source'' means information such as design materials or
    digital code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product
    for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is expressed.
    It may include Notices. 1.3 ''Covered Source'' means Source that is explicitly
    made available under this Licence. 1.4 ''Product'' means any device, component,
    work or physical object, whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from
    the use, application or processing of Covered Source. 1.5 ''Make'' means to create
    or configure something, whether by manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or
    applying Covered Source or another Product or otherwise. 1.6 ''Notice'' means
    copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices, references to the location of
    any Notices, modification notices (subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer
    to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered
    Source. 1.7 ''Licensee'' or ''You'' means any person exercising rights under this
    Licence. 1.8 ''Licensor'' means a person who creates Source or modifies Covered
    Source and subsequently Conveys the resulting Covered Source under the terms and
    conditions of this Licence. A person may be a Licensee and a Licensor at the same
    time. 1.9 ''Convey'' means to communicate to the public or distribute. 2 Applicability
    2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying of Covered
    Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By exercising any right granted
    under this Licence, You irrevocably accept these terms and conditions. 2.2 This
    Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall apply worldwide
    and without limitation in time. 2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract
    or otherwise the rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees. 2.4 This
    Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or any other similar
    right. 3 Copying, modifying and Conveying Covered Source 3.1 You may copy and
    Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any medium, provided You retain all
    Notices. 3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices. You may only delete
    Notices if they are no longer applicable to the corresponding Covered Source as
    modified by You and You may add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.
    3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You shall also
    become a Licensor) provided that You: a) retain Notices as required in subsection
    3.2; and b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You have
    modified it, with the date and brief description of how You have modified it.
    3.4 You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source under licence terms
    which differ from the terms of this Licence provided that: a) You comply at all
    times with subsection 3.3; and b) You provide a copy of this Licence to anyone
    to whom You Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source. 4 Making and Conveying
    Products You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You ensure that
    the recipient of the Product has access to any Notices applicable to the Product.
    5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY 5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and
    any Products are provided ''as is'' and any express or implied warranties, including,
    but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality,
    non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or
    use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the maximum extent permitted
    by law. The Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not
    or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary
    right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or
    Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is
    an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights
    granted under this Licence. 5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor
    shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect,
    special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any
    character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services,
    loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on
    any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability
    or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered
    Source and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility
    of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any
    liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,
    in relation to such use. 6 Patents 6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this Licence, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section 6, or where
    terminated by the Licensor for cause) patent license to Make, have Made, use,
    offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products,
    where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor
    that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as
    Conveyed by that Licensor. 6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any
    entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
    or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this Licence is
    invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall
    terminate as of the date such process is initiated. 7 General 7.1 If any provisions
    of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason,
    the remaining provisions shall remain effective. 7.2 You shall not use any of
    the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor
    or CERN is known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use
    is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall
    not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement
    by the Licensor or its personnel. 7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants
    of this Licence which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published
    with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.
    If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source
    without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released
    under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no variant is specified,
    the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor
    may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the
    CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version
    of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN. 7.4 This Licence
    shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party
    beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.'

    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING
    THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS
    USE. License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT

    THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK
    PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
    THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE
    OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1. Definitions a. "Collective Work" means a work,
    such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
    entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting
    separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
    whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative
    Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. b. "Derivative Work"
    means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
    such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
    picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
    or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except
    that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative
    Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
    is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative
    Work for the purpose of this License. c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity
    that offers the Work under the terms of this License. d. "Original Author" means
    the individual or entity who created the Work. e. "Work" means the copyrightable
    work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. f. "You" means an
    individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously
    violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
    express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite
    a previous violation. g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
    attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike. 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license
    is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first
    sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
    copyright law or other applicable laws. 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
    and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license
    to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to reproduce the Work,
    to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the
    Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; b. to create and reproduce Derivative
    Works; c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
    as incorporated in Collective Works; d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
    display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
    audio transmission Derivative Works; The above rights may be exercised in all
    media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
    the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
    the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
    are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections
    4(e) and 4(f). 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only
    under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
    Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work
    You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.
    You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms
    of this License or the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted hereunder.
    You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
    measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
    the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated
    in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
    the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
    a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested.
    If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
    extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
    clause 4(d), as requested. b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
    or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,
    a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License,
    or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements
    as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must
    include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
    license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each
    Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works
    that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'' exercise
    of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer
    to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with
    any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
    inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
    Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
    the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
    the terms of this License. c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to
    You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
    the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise
    shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
    or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
    compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. d. If you distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or
    any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
    for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
    (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
    the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
    Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
    Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at
    a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
    appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
    credit. e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
    i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
    right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
    ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance
    (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. ii. Mechanical Rights
    and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
    individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
    Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version")
    and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115
    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution
    of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
    advantage or private monetary compensation. f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory
    Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor
    reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights
    society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
    webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section
    114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
    public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
    advantage or private monetary compensation. 5. Representations, Warranties and
    Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
    THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
    OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
    OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on
    Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR
    BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
    PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
    EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who
    have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
    and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms
    and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
    applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves
    the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
    the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve
    to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
    be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
    full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each
    time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You
    distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to
    the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
    as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this
    License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
    the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
    and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall
    be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented
    to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
    be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire
    agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are
    no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not
    specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without
    the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. Creative Commons is not
    a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the
    Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory
    for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified
    itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of
    Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
    Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative
    Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior
    written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with

  - 'CERN OHL v1.2 2013-09-06 - CERN, Geneva, Switzerland CERN Open Hardware Licence
    v1.2 Preamble Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence ("CERN OHL") version 1.2,
    CERN wishes to provide a tool to foster collaboration and sharing among hardware
    designers. The CERN OHL is copyright CERN. Anyone is welcome to use the CERN OHL,
    in unmodified form only, for the distribution of their own Open Hardware designs.
    Any other right is reserved. Release of hardware designs under the CERN OHL does
    not constitute an endorsement of the licensor or its designs nor does it imply
    any involvement by CERN in the development of such designs. 1. Definitions In
    this Licence, the following terms have the following meanings: “Licence” means
    this CERN OHL. “Documentation” means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit
    board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other
    explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the
    conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be in any medium, including
    but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any other
    media. “Documentation Location” means a location where the Licensor has placed
    Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly accessible for at least
    three years from the first communication to the public or distribution of Documentation.
    “Product” means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Documentation
    or the modified Documentation. “Licensee” means any natural or legal person exercising
    rights under this Licence. “Licensor” means any natural or legal person that creates
    or modifies Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or
    distributes the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions of this
    Licence. A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa. Use of
    the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders and is employed
    solely to facilitate reading. 2. Applicability 2.1. This Licence governs the use,
    copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution of the Documentation,
    and the manufacture and distribution of Products. By exercising any right granted
    under this Licence, the Licensee irrevocably accepts these terms and conditions.
    2.2. This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to the Licensee, and shall
    apply worldwide and without limitation in time. The Licensee may assign his licence
    rights or grant sub-licences. 2.3. This Licence does not extend to software, firmware,
    or code loaded into programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with
    the Documentation, the modified Documentation or with Products, unless such software,
    firmware, or code is explicitly expressed to be subject to this Licence. The use
    of such software, firmware, or code is otherwise subject to the applicable licence
    terms and conditions. 3. Copying, modification, communication to the public and
    distribution of the Documentation 3.1. The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright
    and trademarks notices, all notices referring to Documentation Location, and all
    notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are
    included in the Documentation. He shall include a copy thereof in every copy of
    the Documentation or, as the case may be, modified Documentation, that he communicates
    to the public or distributes. 3.2. The Licensee may copy, communicate to the public
    and distribute verbatim copies of the Documentation, in any medium, subject to
    the requirements specified in section 3.1. 3.3. The Licensee may modify the Documentation
    or any portion thereof provided that upon modification of the Documentation, the
    Licensee shall make the modified Documentation available from a Documentation
    Location such that it can be easily located by an original Licensor once the Licensee
    communicates to the public or distributes the modified Documentation under section
    3.4, and, where required by section 4.1, by a recipient of a Product. However,
    the Licensor shall not assert his rights under the foregoing proviso unless or
    until a Product is distributed. 3.4. The Licensee may communicate to the public
    and distribute the modified Documentation (thereby in addition to being a Licensee
    also becoming a Licensor), always provided that he shall: a) comply with section
    3.1; b) cause the modified Documentation to carry prominent notices stating that
    the Licensee has modified the Documentation, with the date and description of
    the modifications; c) cause the modified Documentation to carry a new Documentation
    Location notice if the original Documentation provided for one; d) make available
    the modified Documentation at the same level of abstraction as that of the Documentation,
    in the preferred format for making modifications to it (e.g. the native format
    of the CAD tool as applicable), and in the event that format is proprietary, in
    a format viewable with a tool licensed under an OSI-approved license if the proprietary
    tool can create it; and e) license the modified Documentation under the terms
    and conditions of this Licence or, where applicable, a later version of this Licence
    as may be issued by CERN. 3.5. The Licence includes a non-exclusive licence to

    to the parts of the Documentation or modified Documentation created by the Licensor.
    4. Manufacture and distribution of Products 4.1. The Licensee may manufacture

    requires a licence under this Licence the Licensee provides to each recipient
    of such Products an easy means of accessing a copy of the Documentation or modified
    Documentation, as applicable, as set out in section 3. 4.2. The Licensee is invited
    to inform any Licensor who has indicated his wish to receive this information
    about the type, quantity and dates of production of Products the Licensee has

    warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability,
    of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for
    a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of the Documentation, the
    modified Documentation or any Product. The Licensor makes no representation that
    the Documentation, modified Documentation, or any Product, does or will not infringe
    any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk
    as to the use, quality, and performance of a Product shall be with the Licensee
    and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this
    Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence.
    The Licensee warrants that it does not act in a consumer capacity. 5.2. LIMITATION
    OF LIABILITY – The Licensor shall have no liability for direct, indirect, special,

    of intellectual property rights to the Licensee. 6.2. The Licensee shall not use
    or make reference to any of the names (including acronyms and abbreviations),
    images, or logos under which the Licensor is known, save in so far as required
    to comply with section 3. Any such permitted use or reference shall be factual
    and shall in no event suggest any kind of endorsement by the Licensor or its personnel
    of the modified Documentation or any Product, or any kind of implication by the
    Licensor or its personnel in the preparation of the modified Documentation or
    Product. 6.3. CERN may publish updated versions of this Licence which retain the
    same general provisions as this version, but differ in detail so far this is required
    and reasonable. New versions will be published with a unique version number. 6.4.
    This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect, upon written notice and without
    involvement of a court if the Licensee fails to comply with any of its terms and

    General Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which RealNetworks,
    Inc., or any other entity that elects to use this license, ("Licensor") makes
    publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Licensor identifying
    such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the
    terms of this RealNetworks Public Source License version 1.0 (or subsequent version
    thereof) ("License"). You are not required to accept this License. However, nothing
    else grants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute the software or
    its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept
    this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or distributing the software (or
    any work based on the software), You indicate your acceptance of this License
    to do so, and all its terms and conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms
    of this License by clicking the Accept button or downloading the software. As
    used in this License: 1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where
    Licensor is the grantor of rights, claims of patents that (i) are now or hereafter
    acquired, owned by or assigned to Licensor and (ii) are necessarily infringed
    by using or making the Original Code alone and not in combination with other software
    or hardware; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, claims of
    patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and
    (ii) are infringed (directly or indirectly) by using or making Your Modifications,
    taken alone or in combination with Original Code. 1.2 "Compatible Source License"
    means any one of the licenses listed on Exhibit B or at https://www.helixcommunity.org/content/complicense
    or other licenses specifically identified by Licensor in writing. Notwithstanding
    any term to the contrary in any Compatible Source License, any code covered by
    any Compatible Source License that is used with Covered Code must be made readily
    available in Source Code format for royalty-free use under the terms of the Compatible
    Source License or this License. 1.3 "Contributor" means any person or entity that
    creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications. 1.4 "Covered Code" means
    the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications,

    for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or
    distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.
    1.6 "Derivative Work" means either the Covered Code or any derivative work under
    United States copyright law, and including any work containing or including any
    portion of the Covered Code or Modifications, either verbatim or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language. Derivative Work also includes any work
    which combines any portion of Covered Code or Modifications with code not otherwise
    governed by the terms of this License. 1.7 "Externally Deploy" means to Deploy
    the Covered Code in any way that may be accessed or used by anyone other than
    You, used to provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way
    to deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the Covered Code is distributed

    than You. 1.8. "Interface" means interfaces, functions, properties, class definitions,
    APIs, header files, GUIDs, V-Tables, and/or protocols allowing one piece of software,
    firmware or hardware to communicate or interoperate with another piece of software,

    and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous
    Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications,
    and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files,
    a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
    containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer
    program statements that contains any part of Covered Code. 1.10 "Original Code"
    means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available
    by Licensor under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades
    to such programs or works made available by Licensor under this License, and that
    has been expressly identified by Licensor as such in the header file(s) of such
    work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made
    available by Licensor under this License. 1.11 "Personal Use" means use of Covered
    Code by an individual solely for his or her personal, private and non-commercial
    purposes. An individual''s use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer,
    employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or
    organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.
    1.12 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work that
    is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation

    to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective
    on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or
    otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor''s copyrights cover
    the Original Code, to do the following: 2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform,
    modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance: (a) You must retain
    and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary
    notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep
    intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; (b) You must
    include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code
    and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on
    such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'' rights
    hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6; (c) You must duplicate, to the
    extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
    Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent
    notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; (d) You
    must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications publicly available
    under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section
    3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from
    the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute
    the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from
    a web site); and (e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form
    only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related
    documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under
    the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source
    Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the
    "about" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed,
    including any packaging materials. 2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that
    although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective
    portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor
    or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor
    disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising
    the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
    if a third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import
    or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such
    license(s). 2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
    hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading
    or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License),
    a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor''s
    Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Covered
    Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this License.
    3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
    to You under this License: (a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive,
    perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights
    and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell,
    offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and
    Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor''s licenses
    under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and (b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries
    a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under
    Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or
    controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display,
    perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries),
    sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose,
    through multiple tiers of distribution. (c) You agree not use any information
    derived from Your use and review of the Covered Code, including but not limited
    to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered Code, for
    the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party
    to assert any of its patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor. 4. Derivative
    Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code
    not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative
    Work as an integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements
    of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including
    all Modifications. 4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute,
    publish or Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
    from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
    to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except
    as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative
    Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above.
    4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently
    developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the
    Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined
    in any way with the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative
    Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the
    extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated
    with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must
    be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus,
    the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for
    Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for any independently developed
    software modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies
    even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module
    to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to
    the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License
    v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not
    subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed
    code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The
    general intent of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications
    that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible
    for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under
    Your license to such software. 4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based
    on the Covered Code with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered
    Code) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
    work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination
    and/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for example,
    via automatic updating technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes
    a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this License. 5. Exclusions From License
    Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
    copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
    or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the
    trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the
    Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
    from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor
    otherwise would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or
    any use or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor
    or third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor
    may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the
    Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.
    5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
    or trade names owned by Licensor ("Licensor Marks" defined in Exhibit C) or to
    any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may
    be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than
    as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C. 6. Additional
    Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
    or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the
    license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered
    Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility,
    and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient''s
    agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby
    agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for
    any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor
    by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7. Versions of the License. Licensor may
    publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
    under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the
    terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the
    terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one
    other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
    created under this License. 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain
    in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
    Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
    incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use
    of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.
    THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT
    OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR''S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO
    AS "LICENSOR" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF
    SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET
    ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR
    DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE,
    THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
    THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR
    THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION,
    INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
    OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code
    is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to,
    the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft
    navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in
    which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury,
    or severe physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or
    implied warranty of fitness for such uses. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE
    EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED
    CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN
    IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
    AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS
    DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
    SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor''s total liability
    to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
    this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00). 10. Ownership. Subject
    to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights,
    title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor
    retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
    made by or on behalf of Licensor ("Licensor Modifications"), and such Licensor
    Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may,
    at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this
    License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose
    not to license them at all. 11. Termination. 11.1 Term and Termination. The term
    of this License is perpetual unless terminated as provided below. This License
    and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice
    from Licensor if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail
    to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately
    in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b); or (c) automatically
    without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License,
    commence an action for patent infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim
    or counter claim in a lawsuit); (d) upon written notice from Licensor if You,
    at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
    against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations
    with other software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim
    or counter claim in a lawsuit). 11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination,
    You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing
    and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered
    Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
    which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
    of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond
    the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections
    3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,
    indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License
    in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without
    prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.1 Government
    End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government
    software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights
    customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary
    commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with
    FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department
    of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
    227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).
    Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
    rights set forth herein. 12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be
    construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form
    of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You
    will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance
    or otherwise. 12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
    Licensor''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market
    and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions
    as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or
    products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 12.4 Waiver; Construction.
    Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License
    will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
    construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 12.5 Severability.
    (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
    this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License
    will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic
    benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue
    in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law
    prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections
    2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License
    will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the
    Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.
    12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
    and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle, Washington,
    and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue
    in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License.
    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is
    subject to all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the
    country in which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for
    ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct
    product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or
    without all necessary authorizations. 12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This
    License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
    subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United
    States and the State of Washington. Where You are located in the province of Quebec,
    Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have
    requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
    parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
    rédigés en anglais. EXHIBIT A. " Copyright (c) 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc. and/or

- source_sentence: 'Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
    UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION
    OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    1. DEFINITIONS "Contribution" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor,
    the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in
    the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions
    to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution ''originates''
    from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
    anyone acting on such Contributor''s behalf. Contributions do not include additions
    to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
    with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
    works of the Program. "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes
    the Program. "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
    which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
    when combined with the Program. "Program" means the Contributions distributed
    in accordance with this Agreement. "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program
    under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject
    to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
    of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object
    code form. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer
    the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
    This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
    of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.
    The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
    Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands
    that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth
    herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
    infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
    Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any
    other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
    As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
    hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
    needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that
    to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any,
    to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A
    Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
    own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions
    of this Agreement; and b) its license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf
    of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
    or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively
    excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
    indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
    that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source
    code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees
    how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
    for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form:
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this Agreement
    must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or
    alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must
    identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
    reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
    responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While
    this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
    Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do
    so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
    Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
    such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
    actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent
    caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
    its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations
    in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
    alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of
    such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate
    with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
    The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering,
    Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
    Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product
    X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor''s
    responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have
    to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims
    and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages
    as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
    "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
    is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing
    the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
    this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
    and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT
    AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER
    CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
    OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
    OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,
    EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision
    of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
    affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,
    and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed
    to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations
    of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient''s patent(s),
    then such Recipient''s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
    the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s rights under this Agreement
    shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
    of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
    after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient''s rights under this
    Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program
    as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient''s obligations under this
    Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
    continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
    Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the
    right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time
    to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
    Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse
    Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to
    a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
    be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.
    In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
    elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
    no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
    Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
    in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement
    is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property
    laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a
    legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action
    arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.'

  - 'GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 19 November 2007 Copyright (C) 2007
    Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy
    and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
    allowed. Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
    for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation
    with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most
    software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share
    and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to
    guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
    sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software,
    we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
    to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
    charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
    and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public
    Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,
    and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users'' freedom
    is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive
    widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers
    of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However,
    in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come
    about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting
    the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the
    public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
    that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.
    It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
    modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
    use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access
    to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero
    General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar
    goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero
    has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this
    license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
    follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. "This License" refers to version
    3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. "Copyright" also means copyright-like
    laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. "The Program"
    refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is
    addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
    requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting
    work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the
    earlier work. A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program. To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
    applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
    copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
    making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
    make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
    with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays
    "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently
    visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
    the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
    are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how
    to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands
    or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
    1. Source Code. The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
    defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
    for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
    working in that language. The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
    anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
    of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
    and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
    implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the
    public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
    essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating
    system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
    the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The "Corresponding Source"
    for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install,
    and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
    scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work''s
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
    which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part
    of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
    associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
    and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
    and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything
    that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
    2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the
    term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions
    are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
    unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
    License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This
    License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided
    by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
    You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
    modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
    those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying
    all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
    the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
    material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances
    is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed;
    section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users'' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
    Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
    under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
    treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
    circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any
    legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
    circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect
    to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification
    of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work''s users, your or third
    parties'' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying
    Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program''s source code
    as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
    stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section
    7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
    give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge
    any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support
    or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may
    convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the
    Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that
    you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices
    stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry
    prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions
    added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4
    to "keep intact all notices". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole,
    under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
    will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to
    the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.
    This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If
    the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal
    Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display
    Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of
    a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their
    nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such
    as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
    is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what
    the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
    not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying
    Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the
    terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
    Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a)
    Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical
    distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
    physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object
    code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
    medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid
    for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model,
    to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding
    Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on
    a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price
    no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
    or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer
    to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
    and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
    in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from
    a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
    You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the
    object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
    Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
    equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
    the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
    server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
    is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the
    object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where
    the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
    general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object
    code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System
    Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A "User Product"
    is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property
    which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything
    designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
    is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
    For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers
    to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
    or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product
    regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
    uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization
    keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of
    a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
    Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning
    of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely
    because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this
    section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
    occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
    (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source
    conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
    But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
    the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
    the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information
    does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty,
    or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or
    for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
    may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
    operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
    across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
    provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
    (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and
    must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7.
    Additional Terms. "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms
    of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
    permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though
    they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
    law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may
    be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
    by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey
    a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions
    from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written
    to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may
    place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for
    which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any
    other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may
    (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms
    of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
    from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation
    of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material
    or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting
    misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions
    of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version;
    or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
    of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of
    some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification
    of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or
    modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
    licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
    "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
    by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove
    that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing
    or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
    by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work
    in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement
    of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where
    to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,
    may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate
    or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any
    attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate
    your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
    third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License,
    then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
    and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation
    by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
    holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
    time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
    that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
    receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not
    terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
    under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
    you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section
    10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept
    this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation
    of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other
    than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
    These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
    by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
    License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time
    you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from
    the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
    License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License. An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of
    an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization,
    or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
    transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
    receives whatever licenses to the work the party''s predecessor in interest had
    or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
    has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example,
    you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
    granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
    using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of
    it. 11. Patents. A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
    this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
    thus licensed is called the contributor''s "contributor version". A contributor''s
    "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,
    whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
    manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor
    version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence
    of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
    "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
    with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor''s essential patent
    claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs,
    a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,
    not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or
    covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license
    to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
    against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
    license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
    available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either
    (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
    yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
    arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
    the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered
    work in a country, or your recipient''s use of the covered work in a country,
    would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
    reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction
    or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered
    work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered
    work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
    covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
    recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is "discriminatory"
    if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise
    of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
    you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
    distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on
    the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
    grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you
    (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
    specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered
    into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
    license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
    under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others'' Freedom. If conditions
    are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
    the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
    this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
    as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms
    that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom
    you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Remote Network
    Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must
    prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network
    (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
    Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a
    network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
    copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding
    Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that
    is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered
    work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into
    a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License
    will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with
    which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may
    publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from
    time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is
    given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain
    numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or any later version"
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
    of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero
    General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy''s public
    statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
    version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
    holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer
    of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
    THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
    DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
    AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
    AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
    ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
    OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation
    of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
    provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
    courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver
    of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
    of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS
    AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a
    new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,
    the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute
    and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
    It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
    line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program''s
    name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
    the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software
    Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along
    with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information
    on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact
    with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that
    it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is
    a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link that leads users
    to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
    solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific
    requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
    or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
    For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.'
  - 'Eclipse Public License - v 2.0 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
    TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS
    "Contribution" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
    Distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes
    and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular
    Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to
    the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor''s
    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
    are not Modified Works. "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes
    the Program. "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
    which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
    when combined with the Program. "Program" means the Contributions Distributed
    in accordance with this Agreement. "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program
    under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original
    work of authorship. "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other
    form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents
    of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code
    form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include
    works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures,
    or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name,
    or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof. "Distribute" means the acts
    of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer
    of a copy. "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
    files. "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version
    2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional
    permissions as identified by the initial Contributor. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject
    to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution
    of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works. b) Subject to the terms
    of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
    in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination
    of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
    by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
    to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
    hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by
    any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
    property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
    to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
    property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
    any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
    party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program,
    it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
    the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
    forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License,
    no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set
    forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient''s receipt of the Program
    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section
    3). 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form,
    then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement
    that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs
    Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
    used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program
    under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i)
    effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions,
    express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
    and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
    purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
    damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients''
    rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution
    of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
    of this section 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must
    be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with
    other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License,
    and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described
    in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the
    terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included
    with each copy of the Program. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright,
    patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program
    which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate
    notices. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept
    certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
    like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should
    do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
    Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
    such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
    actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent
    caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with
    its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations
    in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
    alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of
    such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate
    with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
    The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering,
    Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
    Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product
    X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor''s
    responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have
    to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims
    and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages
    as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
    OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
    associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not
    limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
    damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption
    of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
    AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
    STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
    OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any
    provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,
    it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
    of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
    shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
    and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
    itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
    infringes such Recipient''s patent(s), then such Recipient''s rights granted under
    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s
    rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of
    the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure
    in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If
    all Recipient''s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease
    use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
    Recipient''s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
    relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy
    and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the
    Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
    Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions)
    of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
    the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
    Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
    Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement
    will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
    may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which
    it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
    under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
    Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
    under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
    All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is
    not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created
    under this Agreement. Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice "This Source
    Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the
    conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0
    are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions
    here}." Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is
    not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses. If it is not
    possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include
    the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where
    a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional
    accurate notices of copyright ownership.'

    DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH

    ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ
    GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN
    AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN. 1. Definitionen a. Der Begriff "Bearbeitung"
    im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des
    Schutzgegenstandes, solange dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde.
    Dies kann insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung
    oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht
    als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung
    oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff
    "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen,
    künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen,
    sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen
    selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig
    davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln
    zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den
    Schutzgegenstand oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken,
    mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder
    in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Unter "Lizenzelementen" werden im Sinne dieser Lizenz
    die folgenden übergeordneten Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber
    ausgewählt wurden und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz zum Ausdruck kommen: "Namensnennung",
    "Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen". e. Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser
    Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand
    unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin
    auftritt. f. "Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes
    oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person, die am Schutzgegenstand ein
    Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen
    erfasst und eine Erteilung, Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen
    bzw Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt. g. Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet
    in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt,
    der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere
    eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen
    Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines
    verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig
    davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob
    in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von
    Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen
    auch sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz. h. Mit "Sie" bzw.
    "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz
    im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in
    Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen
    oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch
    diese Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
    i. Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Wahrnehmbarmachungen
    des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl
    von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe
    in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung
    oder zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von
    den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener
    oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. j. "Vervielfältigen" im
    Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger,
    in welcher Menge und ob vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke
    des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen,
    und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen
    Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen
    von Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer geschützten
    Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in digitaler Form oder auf
    einem anderen elektronischen Medium. k. "Mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz"
    bezeichnet eine Lizenz, die unter https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses
    aufgelistet ist und die durch Creative Commons als grundsätzlich zur vorliegenden
    Lizenz äquivalent akzeptiert wurde, da zumindest folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt
    sind: Diese mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz i. enthält Bestimmungen, welche
    die gleichen Ziele verfolgen, die gleiche Bedeutung haben und die gleichen Wirkungen
    erzeugen wie die Lizenzelemente der vorliegenden Lizenz; und ii. erlaubt ausdrücklich
    das Lizenzieren von ihr unterstellten Abwandlungen unter vorliegender Lizenz,
    unter einer anderen rechtsordnungsspezifisch angepassten Creative-Commons-Lizenz
    mit denselben Lizenzelementen wie vorliegende Lizenz aufweist oder unter der entsprechenden
    Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz. 2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte Diese
    Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes
    zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen
    der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des
    Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen
    eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Lizenzierung Unter den Bedingungen
    dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte
    und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich
    (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand)
    unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und
    Weise zu nutzen: a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen,
    ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
    b. Den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung
    jedweder Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es
    sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt; c. Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke
    aufgenommen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten; und d. Bearbeitungen
    des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.
    e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
    i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche
    im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum
    Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche
    Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts
    aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen:
    Soweit Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen,
    verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes
    durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich
    lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die
    beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf
    jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche
    durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Die
    vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch nicht
    bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen
    am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige
    Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen
    Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben
    diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten
    Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen
    Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung
    sämtlicher daraus resultierender Rechte. 4. Bedingungen Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung
    gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
    a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser
    Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie
    dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier
    (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder
    fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten
    Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei
    jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben,
    müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss
    hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben,
    dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen,
    die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz
    gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand
    einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das
    Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk
    erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines
    Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise
    entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen, müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel
    ist – auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt
    4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Sie dürfen eine Bearbeitung ausschließlich
    unter den Bedingungen i. dieser Lizenz, ii. einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz
    mit denselben Lizenzelementen, iii. einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz
    mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Weitergabe
    unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US), iv. der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit
    denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder v. einer mit Creative
    Commons kompatiblen Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Falls Sie die
    Bearbeitung gemäß Abschnitt b)(v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen
    Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten. Falls Sie
    die Bearbeitung unter einer der unter b)(i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen ("Verwendbare
    Lizenzen") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen
    Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren
    vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen,
    wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie dürfen keine
    Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen
    der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder
    Bearbeitung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise
    auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn
    Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug
    auf die Bearbeitung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der
    Bearbeitung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte
    behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Bearbeitung
    einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet; dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass
    das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. c. Die
    Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm
    aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der
    Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von
    Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind
    verpflichtet, die Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung
    entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst – soweit bekannt
    – Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet
    wird) des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in
    den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an
    Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung)
    („Zuschreibungsempfänger“), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
    ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier
    (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben
    hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen
    zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes
    in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine
    Bearbeitung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können
    in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes
    oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer
    Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben
    sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt
    dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten
    Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie
    ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers,
    des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit
    irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den
    Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären. d. Die oben
    unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des
    Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen,
    weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen
    Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. (Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit
    sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS
    LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN
    WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER
    DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS
    JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN
    IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN,
    UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT
    DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE
    DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER
    5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IHNEN GEGENÜBER FÜR SCHÄDEN
    JEGLICHER ART NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER
    HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG FÜR FOLGE- ODER ANDERE SCHÄDEN, AUCH WENN
    ER ÜBER DIE MÖGLICHKEIT IHRES EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese
    Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung erlöschen mit Wirkung für
    die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne
    dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung
    einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen,
    die Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke sowie
    entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von
    Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch
    solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen
    halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem
    Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen
    gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand
    ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand
    unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes
    jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung
    oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf
    Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss)
    dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten
    Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal
    wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes
    verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine
    Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form
    dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten
    oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz
    am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen
    Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz
    unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
    d. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie
    als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene
    Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich
    vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich
    vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen
    in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen
    oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht
    genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber
    und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber
    ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht
    gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen
    und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich
    zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß
    8.a) und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus. f. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber
    keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht,
    findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung. Creative
    Commons Notice Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieser Lizenz und übernimmt keinerlei
    Gewähr oder dergleichen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet
    Ihnen oder einer anderen Partei unter keinem rechtlichen Gesichtspunkt für irgendwelche
    Schäden, die - abstrakt oder konkret, zufällig oder vorhersehbar - im Zusammenhang
    mit dieser Lizenz entstehen. Unbeschadet der vorangegangen beiden Sätze, hat Creative
    Commons alle Rechte und Pflichten eines Lizenzgebers, wenn es sich ausdrücklich
    als Lizenzgeber im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet. Creative Commons gewährt den

    DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT.
    JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ
    ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG. DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH
    DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN
    LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG
    ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE
    UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
    AKZEPTIEREN. 1. Definitionen a. Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz
    bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes,
    solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen
    und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung,
    Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes
    zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes
    gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung
    des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint
    eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen
    Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der
    darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig
    davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln
    zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den
    Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken,
    mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr
    zu bringen. d. Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche
    oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen
    dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. "Rechteinhaber"
    im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere
    natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand
    ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen
    erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung
    an Dritte möglich ist. f. Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser
    Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter
    den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche
    geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes
    Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts
    sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche
    Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler
    Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen
    Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand"
    im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihne*" ist die natürliche oder juristische
    Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes
    vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen
    dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers
    erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen
    Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind
    Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die
    für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher
    Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung,
    Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung
    oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten
    Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren,
    einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
    i. "Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren
    Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch
    Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche
    Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen
    anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder
    Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler
    oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in
    keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu
    vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken
    des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder
    sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung
    von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber
    - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - das
    vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand)
    unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten
    und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für
    jedermann"): a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen,
    ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
    b. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen
    unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es
    sich um Abwandlungen handelt; c. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke
    aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten; d. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes
    zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht
    wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt.
    Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen,
    die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich
    sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich
    durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit
    Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder
    Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen,
    verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte.
    4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz
    erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand
    ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich
    zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige
    Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen
    keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen
    dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen
    den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes,
    die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert
    lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den
    Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den
    Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes
    in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können.
    Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen
    Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk
    insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen,
    müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in
    Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen,
    müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in
    Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß
    Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen
    Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ("nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung",
    "Non-commercial-Option"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand
    dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche
    Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht
    als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn
    in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung
    oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. c. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche
    Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender
    Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich
    etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke
    unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der
    Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt
    - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet
    wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in
    den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an
    Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung)
    ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
    ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier
    (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben
    hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen
    zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes
    in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine
    Abwandlung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können
    in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes
    oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer
    Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso
    hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben
    nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft
    in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus
    dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende
    Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit
    noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger
    und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. d. Die
    oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile
    des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff
    fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen
    Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes
    gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare
    Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme
    (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das
    ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung
    eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern
    Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält
    sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden
    Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere
    als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen,
    verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche
    Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung
    des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte
    (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig
    davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft
    möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf
    Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft)
    für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als
    die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. f. Persönlichkeitsrechte
    bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung
    SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER
    UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN,
    BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER
    AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT
    GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND
    RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT
    DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE
    DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT,
    SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN
    DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS
    VORLIEGT. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG
    AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR,
    SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR
    BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI
    FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten
    Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes
    gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers
    vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit
    natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes
    oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen
    erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange
    weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen
    halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem
    Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen
    gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand
    ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand
    unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes
    jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung
    oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf
    Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss)
    dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten
    Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal
    wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes
    verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz
    zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser
    Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten
    oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen
    Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen
    in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein,
    so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. d. Keine Bestimmung
    dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten,
    solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich
    zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen
    Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen)
    stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug
    auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen
    in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche
    Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über
    Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche,
    einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann
    nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert
    werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und
    Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) und b) angeboteten
    Lizenzen aus. f. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige
    Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen
    Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung. Creative Commons
    Notice Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieser Lizenz und übernimmt keinerlei

    Ihnen oder einer anderen Partei unter keinem rechtlichen Gesichtspunkt für irgendwelche

    Nordrhein-Westfalen 2004 Erstellt von Axel Metzger und Till Jaeger, Institut für
    Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software - ( http://www.ifross.de ) .
    Präambel Software ist mehr als ein Wirtschaftsgut. Sie ist die technische Grundlage
    der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Frage der Teilhabe der Allgemeinheit ist deswegen
    von besonderer Bedeutung. Herkömmlich lizenzierte Programme werden nur im Object
    Code vertrieben, der Nutzer darf das Programm weder verändern noch weitergeben.
    Das Lizenzmodell der Freien Software (synonym "Open Source Software") gewährt
    Ihnen dagegen umfassende Freiheiten im Umgang mit dem Programm. Die Deutsche Freie
    Software Lizenz folgt diesem Lizenzmodell. Sie gewährt Ihnen das Recht, das Programm
    in umfassender Weise zu nutzen. Es ist Ihnen gestattet, das Programm nach Ihren
    Vorstellungen zu verändern, in veränderter oder unveränderter Form zu vervielfältigen,
    zu verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich zu machen. Diese Rechte werden unentgeltlich
    eingeräumt. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz verbindet die Rechtseinräumung
    allerdings mit Pflichten, die dem Zweck dienen, das freie Zirkulieren des Programms
    und aller veröffentlichten Fortentwicklungen zu sichern. Wenn Sie das Programm
    verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie jedem, der das Programm
    von Ihnen erhält, eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitliefern und den Zugriff auf den
    Source Code ermöglichen. Eine weitere Pflicht betrifft Fortentwicklungen des Programms.
    Änderungen am Programm, die Sie öffentlich verbreiten oder zugänglich machen,
    müssen nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz frei gegeben werden. Die Deutsche Freie
    Software Lizenz nimmt auf die besonderen Anforderungen des deutschen und europäischen
    Rechts Rücksicht. Sie ist zweisprachig gestaltet und damit auch auf den internationalen
    Vertrieb ausgerichtet. § 0 Definitionen Dokumentation: Die Beschreibung des Aufbaus
    und/oder der Struktur der Programmierung und/oder der Funktionalitäten des Programms,
    unabhängig davon, ob sie im Source Code oder gesondert vorgenommen wird. Lizenz:
    Die zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen geschlossene Vereinbarung mit dem Inhalt
    der "Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz" bzw. das Angebot hierzu. Lizenznehmer:
    Jede natürliche oder juristische Person, die die Lizenz angenommen hat. Programm:
    Jedes Computerprogramm, das von den Rechtsinhabern nach den Bestimmungen dieser
    Lizenz verbreitet oder öffentlich zugänglich gemacht worden ist. Object Code:
    Die maschinenlesbare, übersetzte Form des Programms. Öffentlich: Nicht nur an
    einen bestimmten Personenkreis gerichtet, der persönlich oder durch die Zugehörigkeit
    zu einer juristischen Person oder einem öffentlichen Träger miteinander verbunden
    ist. Öffentlich zugänglich machen: Die öffentliche Weitergabe des Programms in
    unkörperlicher Form, insbesondere das Bereithalten zum Download in Datennetzen.
    Rechtsinhaber: Der bzw. die Urheber oder sonstigen Inhaber der ausschließlichen
    Nutzungsrechte an dem Programm. Source Code: Die für Menschen lesbare, in Programmiersprache
    dargestellte Form des Programms. Verändern: Jede Erweiterung, Kürzung und Bearbeitung
    des Programms, insbesondere Weiterentwicklungen. Verbreiten: Die öffentliche Weitergabe
    körperlicher Vervielfältigungsstücke, insbesondere auf Datenträgern oder in Verbindung
    mit Hardware. Vollständiger Source Code: Der Source Code in der für die Erstellung
    bzw. die Bearbeitung benutzten Form zusammen mit den zur Übersetzung und Installation
    erforderlichen Konfigurationsdateien und Software-Werkzeugen, sofern diese in
    der benötigten Form nicht allgemein gebräuchlich (z.B. Standard-Kompiler) oder
    für jedermann lizenzgebührenfrei im Internet abrufbar sind. § 1 Rechte (1) Sie
    dürfen das Programm in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich
    zugänglich machen. (2) Sie dürfen das Programm verändern und entsprechend veränderte
    Versionen vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. Gestattet
    ist auch die Kombination des Programms oder Teilen hiervon mit anderen Programmen.
    (3) Sie erhalten die Rechte unentgeltlich. § 2 Pflichten beim Vertrieb (1) Wenn
    Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, sei es in unveränderter
    oder veränderter Form, sei es in einer Kombination mit anderen Programmen oder
    in Verbindung mit Hardware, dann müssen sie mitliefern: 1. alle Vermerke im Source
    Code und/oder Object Code, die auf diese Lizenz hinweisen; 2. alle Vermerke im
    Source Code und/oder Object Code, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft
    geben; 3. einen für den Empfänger deutlich wahrnehmbaren Hinweis auf diese Lizenz
    und die Internetadresse < http://www.d-fsl.de > ; 4. den vollständigen Text dieser
    Lizenz in deutlich wahrnehmbarer Weise. (2) Wenn bei der Installation des Programms
    und/oder beim Programmstart Lizenz- und/oder Vertragsbedingungen angezeigt werden,
    dann müssen 1. diese Lizenz, 2. ein Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und 3. ein Hinweis
    auf den oder die Rechtsinhaber an den ersten unter dieser Lizenz nutzbaren Programmbestandteilen
    ebenfalls angezeigt werden. (3) Sie dürfen die Nutzung des Programms nicht von
    Pflichten oder Bedingungen abhängig machen, die nicht in dieser Lizenz vorgesehen
    sind. (4) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss
    diese Dokumentation entsprechend mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung
    der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet.
    § 3 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb veränderter Versionen (1) Veränderte Versionen
    des Programms dürfen Sie nur unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder
    öffentlich zugänglich machen, so dass Dritte das veränderte Programm insgesamt
    unter dieser Lizenz nutzen können. (2) Wird das Programm oder ein Teil hiervon
    mit einem anderen Programm kombiniert, gilt auch die Kombination insgesamt als
    eine veränderte Version des Programms, es sei denn, das andere Programm ist formal
    und inhaltlich eigenständig. Ein anderes Programm ist dann als eigenständig anzusehen,
    wenn es die folgenden Voraussetzungen alle erfüllt: 1. Der Source Code der kombinierten
    Programme muss jeweils in eigenen Dateien vorhanden sein, die keine Bestandteile
    des anderen Teils enthalten, die über die zur Programmkombination üblichen und
    erforderlichen Informationen über den anderen Teil hinausgehen, wobei der Source
    Code des anderen Programms nicht mitgeliefert werden muss. 2. Der mit dem Programm
    kombinierte Teil muss auch dann sinnvoll nutzbar sein, wenn er nicht mit dem Programm
    kombiniert wird, und zwar entweder alleine oder mit sonstigen Programmen. Was
    als "sinnvoll nutzbar" anzusehen ist, richtet sich nach der Auffassung der betroffenen
    Fachkreise. Zu den betroffenen Fachkreisen gehören alle Personen, die das Programm
    oder Programme mit vergleichbarer Funktionalität entwickeln, benutzen, verbreiten
    oder öffentlich zugänglich machen. (3) Wenn Sie das Programm oder einen Teil hiervon
    - verändert oder unverändert - zusammen mit einem anderen Programm verbreiten
    oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, das unter der GNU General Public License (GPL)
    lizenziert wird, darf das Programm auch unter den Bedingungen der GPL genutzt
    werden, sofern es mit dem anderen Programm ein "derivative work" im Sinne der
    GPL bildet. Dabei sollen die Hinweise auf diese Lizenz entfernt und durch einen
    Hinweis auf die GPL ersetzt werden. Ob bei der Zusammenstellung ein "derivate
    work" im Sinne der GPL entsteht, beurteilt sich nach Ziffer 2 b) der GPL. Diese
    Bestimmung lautet: "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License." Die GPL kann abgerufen werden unter http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.
    (4) Wenn Sie das Programm in einer veränderten Form verbreiten oder öffentlich
    zugänglich machen, müssen Sie im Source Code einen Hinweis mit den Änderungen
    aufnehmen und mit dem Datum der Änderung versehen. Der Hinweis muss erkennen lassen,
    welche Änderungen vorgenommen wurden und bestehende Vermerke, die über die Urheber
    des Programms Auskunft geben, übernehmen. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob Sie einen
    eigenen Urhebervermerk hinzufügen. Anstelle eines Hinweises im Source Code können
    Sie auch ein Versionskontrollsystem verwenden oder weiterführen, sofern dieses
    mitverbreitet wird oder öffentlich zugänglich ist. (5) Sie dürfen von Dritten
    für die Einräumung eines einfachen Nutzungsrechts an veränderten Versionen des
    Programms kein Entgelt verlangen. (6) Wenn Sie an der veränderten Version des
    Programms ein anderes Schutzrecht als ein Urheberrecht erwerben, insbesondere
    ein Patent oder Gebrauchsmuster, lizenzieren Sie dieses Schutzrecht für veränderte
    und unveränderte Versionen des Programms in dem Umfang, der erforderlich ist,
    um die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz wahrnehmen zu können. § 4 Weitere Pflichten beim
    Vertrieb im Object Code (1) Wenn Sie das Programm nur im Object Code verbreiten,
    dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten entweder
    1. den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und
    bei der Verbreitung des Object Codes deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse
    hinweisen, unter der der Source Code abgerufen werden kann oder 2. den vollständigen
    Source Code auf einem hierfür üblichen Datenträger unter Beachtung der §§ 2 und
    3 mitverbreiten. (2) Wenn Sie das Programm im Object Code öffentlich zugänglich
    machen, dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten
    den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und dabei
    deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen. (3) Sofern Sie mit dem
    Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend
    der Absätze 1 und 2 mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der
    Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet.
    § 5 Vertragsschluss (1) Mit dieser Lizenz wird Ihnen und jeder anderen Person
    ein Angebot auf Abschluss eines Vertrages über die Nutzung des Programms unter
    den Bedingungen der Deutschen Freien Softwarelizenz unterbreitet. (2) Sie dürfen
    das Programm nach den jeweils anwendbaren gesetzlichen Vorschriften bestimmungsgemäß
    benutzen, ohne dass es der Annahme dieser Lizenz bedarf. Dieses Recht umfasst
    in der Europäischen Union und in den meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen insbesondere
    die folgenden Befugnisse: 1. das Programm ablaufen zu lassen sowie die Erstellung
    von hierfür erforderlichen Vervielfältigungen im Haupt- und Arbeitsspeicher; 2.
    das Erstellen einer Sicherungskopie; 3. die Fehlerberichtigung; 4. die Weitergabe
    einer rechtmäßig erworbenen körperlichen Kopie des Programms. (3) Sie erklären
    Ihre Zustimmung zum Abschluss dieser Lizenz, indem Sie das Programm verbreiten,
    öffentlich zugänglich machen, verändern oder in einer Weise vervielfältigen, die
    über die bestimmungsgemäße Nutzung im Sinne von Absatz 2 hinausgeht. Ab diesem
    Zeitpunkt ist diese Lizenz als rechtlich verbindlicher Vertrag zwischen den Rechtsinhabern
    und Ihnen geschlossen, ohne dass es eines Zugangs der Annahmeerklärung bei den
    Rechtsinhabern bedarf. (4) Sie und jeder andere Lizenznehmer erhalten die Rechte
    aus dieser Lizenz direkt von den Rechtsinhabern. Eine Unterlizenzierung oder Übertragung
    der Rechte ist nicht gestattet. § 6 Beendigung der Rechte bei Zuwiderhandlung
    (1) Jede Verletzung Ihrer Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz führt zu einer automatischen
    Beendigung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz. (2) Die Rechte Dritter, die das Programm
    oder Rechte an dem Programm von Ihnen erhalten haben, bleiben hiervon unberührt.
    § 7 Haftung und Gewährleistung (1) Für entgegenstehende Rechte Dritter haften
    die Rechtsinhaber nur, sofern sie Kenntnis von diesen Rechten hatten, ohne Sie
    zu informieren. (2) Die Haftung für Fehler und sonstige Mängel des Programms richtet
    sich nach den außerhalb dieser Lizenz getroffenen Vereinbarungen zwischen Ihnen
    und den Rechtsinhabern oder, wenn eine solche Vereinbarung nicht existiert, nach
    den gesetzlichen Regelungen. § 8 Verträge mit Dritten (1) Diese Lizenz regelt
    nur die Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern. Sie ist nicht Bestandteil
    der Verträge zwischen Ihnen und Dritten. (2) Die Lizenz beschränkt Sie nicht in
    der Freiheit, mit Dritten, die von Ihnen Kopien des Programms erhalten oder Leistungen
    in Anspruch nehmen, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Programm stehen, Verträge beliebigen
    Inhalts zu schließen, sofern Sie dabei Ihren Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz
    nachkommen und die Rechte der Dritten aus dieser Lizenz nicht beeinträchtigt werden.
    Insbesondere dürfen Sie für die Überlassung des Programms oder sonstige Leistungen
    ein Entgelt verlangen. (3) Diese Lizenz verpflichtet Sie nicht, das Programm an
    Dritte weiterzugeben. Es steht Ihnen frei zu entscheiden, wem Sie das Programm
    zugänglich machen. Sie dürfen aber die weitere Nutzung durch Dritte nicht durch
    den Einsatz technischer Schutzmaßnahmen, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von Kopierschutzvorrichtungen
    jeglicher Art, verhindern oder erschweren. Eine passwortgeschützte Zugangsbeschränkung
    oder die Nutzung in einem Intranet wird nicht als technische Schutzmaßnahme angesehen.
    § 9 Text der Lizenz (1) Diese Lizenz ist in deutscher und englischer Sprache abgefasst.
    Beide Fassungen sind gleich verbindlich. Es wird unterstellt, dass die in der
    Lizenz verwandten Begriffe in beiden Fassungen dieselbe Bedeutung haben. Ergeben
    sich dennoch Unterschiede, so ist die Bedeutung maßgeblich, welche die Fassungen
    unter Berücksichtigung des Ziels und Zwecks der Lizenz am besten miteinander in
    Einklang bringt. (2) Der Lizenzrat der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz kann mit
    verbindlicher Wirkung neue Versionen der Lizenz in Kraft setzen, soweit dies erforderlich
    und zumutbar ist. Neue Versionen der Lizenz werden auf der Internetseite http://www.d-fsl.de
    mit einer eindeutigen Versionsnummer veröffentlicht. Die neue Version der Lizenz
    erlangt für Sie verbindliche Wirkung, wenn Sie von deren Veröffentlichung Kenntnis
    genommen haben. Gesetzliche Rechtsbehelfe gegen die Änderung der Lizenz werden
    durch die vorstehenden Bestimmungen nicht beschränkt. (3) Sie dürfen diese Lizenz
    in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen.
    § 10 Anwendbares Recht Auf diese Lizenz findet deutsches Recht Anwendung. Anhang:
    Wie unterstellen Sie ein Programm der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz? Um jedermann
    den Abschluss dieser Lizenz zu ermöglichen, wird empfohlen, das Programm mit folgendem
    Hinweis auf die Lizenz zu versehen: "Copyright (C) 20[jj] [Name des Rechtsinhabers].

DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG. DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN. 1. Definitionen a. Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Unter "Lizenzelementen" werden im Sinne dieser Lizenz die folgenden übergeordneten Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt wurden und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz zum Ausdruck kommen: "Namensnennung", "Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen". e. Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. f. "Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung, Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt. g. Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz. h. Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. i. Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. j. "Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium. k. "Mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz" bezeichnet eine Lizenz, die unter https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses aufgelistet ist und die durch Creative Commons als grundsätzlich zur vorliegenden Lizenz äquivalent akzeptiert wurde, da zumindest folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind: Diese mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz i. enthält Bestimmungen, welche die gleichen Ziele verfolgen, die gleiche Bedeutung haben und die gleichen Wirkungen erzeugen wie die Lizenzelemente der vorliegenden Lizenz; und ii. erlaubt ausdrücklich das Lizenzieren von ihr unterstellten Abwandlungen unter vorliegender Lizenz, unter einer anderen rechtsordnungsspezifisch angepassten Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen wie vorliegende Lizenz aufweist oder unter der entsprechenden Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz. 2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Lizenzierung Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen: a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. Den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt; c. Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten; und d. Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten. e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Soweit Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher daraus resultierender Rechte. 4. Bedingungen Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen, müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel ist – auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Sie dürfen eine Bearbeitung ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen i. dieser Lizenz, ii. einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen, iii. einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US), iv. der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder v. einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Falls Sie die Bearbeitung gemäß Abschnitt b)(v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten. Falls Sie die Bearbeitung unter einer der unter b)(i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen ("Verwendbare Lizenzen") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Bearbeitung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Bearbeitung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Bearbeitung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Bearbeitung einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet; dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. c. Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst – soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger“), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären. d. Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. (Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IHNEN GEGENÜBER FÜR SCHÄDEN JEGLICHER ART NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG FÜR FOLGE- ODER ANDERE SCHÄDEN, AUCH WENN ER ÜBER DIE MÖGLICHKEIT IHRES EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke sowie entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. d. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß 8.a) und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus. f. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieser Lizenz und übernimmt keinerlei Gewähr oder dergleichen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet Ihnen oder einer anderen Partei unter keinem rechtlichen Gesichtspunkt für irgendwelche Schäden, die - abstrakt oder konkret, zufällig oder vorhersehbar - im Zusammenhang mit dieser Lizenz entstehen. Unbeschadet der vorangegangen beiden Sätze, hat Creative Commons alle Rechte und Pflichten eines Lizenzgebers, wenn es sich ausdrücklich als Lizenzgeber im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet. Creative Commons gewährt den Parteien nur insoweit das Recht, das Logo und die Marke "Creative Commons" zu nutzen, als dies notwendig ist, um der Öffentlichkeit gegenüber kenntlich zu machen, dass der Schutzgegenstand unter einer CCPL steht. Ein darüber hinaus gehender Gebrauch der Marke "Creative Commons" oder einer verwandten Marke oder eines verwandten Logos bedarf der vorherigen schriftlichen Zustimmung von Creative Commons. Jeder erlaubte Gebrauch richtet sich nach der Creative Commons Marken-Nutzungs-Richtlinie in der jeweils aktuellen Fassung, die von Zeit zu Zeit auf der Website veröffentlicht oder auf andere Weise auf Anfrage zugänglich gemacht wird.

SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN. 1. Definitionen a. Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. "Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. "Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. f. Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihne*" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. i. "Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann"): a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt; c. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten; d. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ("nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung", "Non-commercial-Option"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. c. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. d. Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. f. Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. d. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) und b) angeboteten Lizenzen aus. f. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieser Lizenz und übernimmt keinerlei Gewähr oder dergleichen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet Ihnen oder einer anderen Partei unter keinem rechtlichen Gesichtspunkt für irgendwelche Schäden, die - abstrakt oder konkret, zufällig oder vorhersehbar - im Zusammenhang mit dieser Lizenz entstehen.

    'Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz (c) Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung Nordrhein-Westfalen 2004 Erstellt von Axel Metzger und Till Jaeger, Institut für Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software - ( http://www.ifross.de ) . Präambel Software ist mehr als ein Wirtschaftsgut. Sie ist die technische Grundlage der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Frage der Teilhabe der Allgemeinheit ist deswegen von besonderer Bedeutung. Herkömmlich lizenzierte Programme werden nur im Object Code vertrieben, der Nutzer darf das Programm weder verändern noch weitergeben. Das Lizenzmodell der Freien Software (synonym "Open Source Software") gewährt Ihnen dagegen umfassende Freiheiten im Umgang mit dem Programm. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz folgt diesem Lizenzmodell. Sie gewährt Ihnen das Recht, das Programm in umfassender Weise zu nutzen. Es ist Ihnen gestattet, das Programm nach Ihren Vorstellungen zu verändern, in veränderter oder unveränderter Form zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich zu machen. Diese Rechte werden unentgeltlich eingeräumt. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz verbindet die Rechtseinräumung allerdings mit Pflichten, die dem Zweck dienen, das freie Zirkulieren des Programms und aller veröffentlichten Fortentwicklungen zu sichern. Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie jedem, der das Programm von Ihnen erhält, eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitliefern und den Zugriff auf den Source Code ermöglichen. Eine weitere Pflicht betrifft Fortentwicklungen des Programms. Änderungen am Programm, die Sie öffentlich verbreiten oder zugänglich machen, müssen nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz frei gegeben werden. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz nimmt auf die besonderen Anforderungen des deutschen und europäischen Rechts Rücksicht. Sie ist zweisprachig gestaltet und damit auch auf den internationalen Vertrieb ausgerichtet. § 0 Definitionen Dokumentation: Die Beschreibung des Aufbaus und/oder der Struktur der Programmierung und/oder der Funktionalitäten des Programms, unabhängig davon, ob sie im Source Code oder gesondert vorgenommen wird. Lizenz: Die zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen geschlossene Vereinbarung mit dem Inhalt der "Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz" bzw. das Angebot hierzu. Lizenznehmer: Jede natürliche oder juristische Person, die die Lizenz angenommen hat. Programm: Jedes Computerprogramm, das von den Rechtsinhabern nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz verbreitet oder öffentlich zugänglich gemacht worden ist. Object Code: Die maschinenlesbare, übersetzte Form des Programms. Öffentlich: Nicht nur an einen bestimmten Personenkreis gerichtet, der persönlich oder durch die Zugehörigkeit zu einer juristischen Person oder einem öffentlichen Träger miteinander verbunden ist. Öffentlich zugänglich machen: Die öffentliche Weitergabe des Programms in unkörperlicher Form, insbesondere das Bereithalten zum Download in Datennetzen. Rechtsinhaber: Der bzw. die Urheber oder sonstigen Inhaber der ausschließlichen Nutzungsrechte an dem Programm. Source Code: Die für Menschen lesbare, in Programmiersprache dargestellte Form des Programms. Verändern: Jede Erweiterung, Kürzung und Bearbeitung des Programms, insbesondere Weiterentwicklungen. Verbreiten: Die öffentliche Weitergabe körperlicher Vervielfältigungsstücke, insbesondere auf Datenträgern oder in Verbindung mit Hardware. Vollständiger Source Code: Der Source Code in der für die Erstellung bzw. die Bearbeitung benutzten Form zusammen mit den zur Übersetzung und Installation erforderlichen Konfigurationsdateien und Software-Werkzeugen, sofern diese in der benötigten Form nicht allgemein gebräuchlich (z.B. Standard-Kompiler) oder für jedermann lizenzgebührenfrei im Internet abrufbar sind. § 1 Rechte (1) Sie dürfen das Programm in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. (2) Sie dürfen das Programm verändern und entsprechend veränderte Versionen vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. Gestattet ist auch die Kombination des Programms oder Teilen hiervon mit anderen Programmen. (3) Sie erhalten die Rechte unentgeltlich. § 2 Pflichten beim Vertrieb (1) Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, sei es in unveränderter oder veränderter Form, sei es in einer Kombination mit anderen Programmen oder in Verbindung mit Hardware, dann müssen sie mitliefern: 1. alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die auf diese Lizenz hinweisen; 2. alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben; 3. einen für den Empfänger deutlich wahrnehmbaren Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und die Internetadresse < http://www.d-fsl.de > ; 4. den vollständigen Text dieser Lizenz in deutlich wahrnehmbarer Weise. (2) Wenn bei der Installation des Programms und/oder beim Programmstart Lizenz- und/oder Vertragsbedingungen angezeigt werden, dann müssen 1. diese Lizenz, 2. ein Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und 3. ein Hinweis auf den oder die Rechtsinhaber an den ersten unter dieser Lizenz nutzbaren Programmbestandteilen ebenfalls angezeigt werden. (3) Sie dürfen die Nutzung des Programms nicht von Pflichten oder Bedingungen abhängig machen, die nicht in dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind. (4) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet. § 3 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb veränderter Versionen (1) Veränderte Versionen des Programms dürfen Sie nur unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, so dass Dritte das veränderte Programm insgesamt unter dieser Lizenz nutzen können. (2) Wird das Programm oder ein Teil hiervon mit einem anderen Programm kombiniert, gilt auch die Kombination insgesamt als eine veränderte Version des Programms, es sei denn, das andere Programm ist formal und inhaltlich eigenständig. Ein anderes Programm ist dann als eigenständig anzusehen, wenn es die folgenden Voraussetzungen alle erfüllt: 1. Der Source Code der kombinierten Programme muss jeweils in eigenen Dateien vorhanden sein, die keine Bestandteile des anderen Teils enthalten, die über die zur Programmkombination üblichen und erforderlichen Informationen über den anderen Teil hinausgehen, wobei der Source Code des anderen Programms nicht mitgeliefert werden muss. 2. Der mit dem Programm kombinierte Teil muss auch dann sinnvoll nutzbar sein, wenn er nicht mit dem Programm kombiniert wird, und zwar entweder alleine oder mit sonstigen Programmen. Was als "sinnvoll nutzbar" anzusehen ist, richtet sich nach der Auffassung der betroffenen Fachkreise. Zu den betroffenen Fachkreisen gehören alle Personen, die das Programm oder Programme mit vergleichbarer Funktionalität entwickeln, benutzen, verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen. (3) Wenn Sie das Programm oder einen Teil hiervon - verändert oder unverändert - zusammen mit einem anderen Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, das unter der GNU General Public License (GPL) lizenziert wird, darf das Programm auch unter den Bedingungen der GPL genutzt werden, sofern es mit dem anderen Programm ein "derivative work" im Sinne der GPL bildet. Dabei sollen die Hinweise auf diese Lizenz entfernt und durch einen Hinweis auf die GPL ersetzt werden. Ob bei der Zusammenstellung ein "derivate work" im Sinne der GPL entsteht, beurteilt sich nach Ziffer 2 b) der GPL. Diese Bestimmung lautet: "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License." Die GPL kann abgerufen werden unter http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl. (4) Wenn Sie das Programm in einer veränderten Form verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, müssen Sie im Source Code einen Hinweis mit den Änderungen aufnehmen und mit dem Datum der Änderung versehen. Der Hinweis muss erkennen lassen, welche Änderungen vorgenommen wurden und bestehende Vermerke, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben, übernehmen. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob Sie einen eigenen Urhebervermerk hinzufügen. Anstelle eines Hinweises im Source Code können Sie auch ein Versionskontrollsystem verwenden oder weiterführen, sofern dieses mitverbreitet wird oder öffentlich zugänglich ist. (5) Sie dürfen von Dritten für die Einräumung eines einfachen Nutzungsrechts an veränderten Versionen des Programms kein Entgelt verlangen. (6) Wenn Sie an der veränderten Version des Programms ein anderes Schutzrecht als ein Urheberrecht erwerben, insbesondere ein Patent oder Gebrauchsmuster, lizenzieren Sie dieses Schutzrecht für veränderte und unveränderte Versionen des Programms in dem Umfang, der erforderlich ist, um die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz wahrnehmen zu können. § 4 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb im Object Code (1) Wenn Sie das Programm nur im Object Code verbreiten, dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten entweder 1. den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und bei der Verbreitung des Object Codes deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen, unter der der Source Code abgerufen werden kann oder 2. den vollständigen Source Code auf einem hierfür üblichen Datenträger unter Beachtung der §§ 2 und 3 mitverbreiten. (2) Wenn Sie das Programm im Object Code öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und dabei deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen. (3) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend der Absätze 1 und 2 mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet. § 5 Vertragsschluss (1) Mit dieser Lizenz wird Ihnen und jeder anderen Person ein Angebot auf Abschluss eines Vertrages über die Nutzung des Programms unter den Bedingungen der Deutschen Freien Softwarelizenz unterbreitet. (2) Sie dürfen das Programm nach den jeweils anwendbaren gesetzlichen Vorschriften bestimmungsgemäß benutzen, ohne dass es der Annahme dieser Lizenz bedarf. Dieses Recht umfasst in der Europäischen Union und in den meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen insbesondere die folgenden Befugnisse: 1. das Programm ablaufen zu lassen sowie die Erstellung von hierfür erforderlichen Vervielfältigungen im Haupt- und Arbeitsspeicher; 2. das Erstellen einer Sicherungskopie; 3. die Fehlerberichtigung; 4. die Weitergabe einer rechtmäßig erworbenen körperlichen Kopie des Programms. (3) Sie erklären Ihre Zustimmung zum Abschluss dieser Lizenz, indem Sie das Programm verbreiten, öffentlich zugänglich machen, verändern oder in einer Weise vervielfältigen, die über die bestimmungsgemäße Nutzung im Sinne von Absatz 2 hinausgeht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist diese Lizenz als rechtlich verbindlicher Vertrag zwischen den Rechtsinhabern und Ihnen geschlossen, ohne dass es eines Zugangs der Annahmeerklärung bei den Rechtsinhabern bedarf. (4) Sie und jeder andere Lizenznehmer erhalten die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz direkt von den Rechtsinhabern. Eine Unterlizenzierung oder Übertragung der Rechte ist nicht gestattet. § 6 Beendigung der Rechte bei Zuwiderhandlung (1) Jede Verletzung Ihrer Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz führt zu einer automatischen Beendigung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz. (2) Die Rechte Dritter, die das Programm oder Rechte an dem Programm von Ihnen erhalten haben, bleiben hiervon unberührt. § 7 Haftung und Gewährleistung (1) Für entgegenstehende Rechte Dritter haften die Rechtsinhaber nur, sofern sie Kenntnis von diesen Rechten hatten, ohne Sie zu informieren. (2) Die Haftung für Fehler und sonstige Mängel des Programms richtet sich nach den außerhalb dieser Lizenz getroffenen Vereinbarungen zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern oder, wenn eine solche Vereinbarung nicht existiert, nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen. § 8 Verträge mit Dritten (1) Diese Lizenz regelt nur die Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern. Sie ist nicht Bestandteil der Verträge zwischen Ihnen und Dritten. (2) Die Lizenz beschränkt Sie nicht in der Freiheit, mit Dritten, die von Ihnen Kopien des Programms erhalten oder Leistungen in Anspruch nehmen, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Programm stehen, Verträge beliebigen Inhalts zu schließen, sofern Sie dabei Ihren Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz nachkommen und die Rechte der Dritten aus dieser Lizenz nicht beeinträchtigt werden. Insbesondere dürfen Sie für die Überlassung des Programms oder sonstige Leistungen ein Entgelt verlangen. (3) Diese Lizenz verpflichtet Sie nicht, das Programm an Dritte weiterzugeben. Es steht Ihnen frei zu entscheiden, wem Sie das Programm zugänglich machen. Sie dürfen aber die weitere Nutzung durch Dritte nicht durch den Einsatz technischer Schutzmaßnahmen, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von Kopierschutzvorrichtungen jeglicher Art, verhindern oder erschweren. Eine passwortgeschützte Zugangsbeschränkung oder die Nutzung in einem Intranet wird nicht als technische Schutzmaßnahme angesehen. § 9 Text der Lizenz (1) Diese Lizenz ist in deutscher und englischer Sprache abgefasst. Beide Fassungen sind gleich verbindlich. Es wird unterstellt, dass die in der Lizenz verwandten Begriffe in beiden Fassungen dieselbe Bedeutung haben. Ergeben sich dennoch Unterschiede, so ist die Bedeutung maßgeblich, welche die Fassungen unter Berücksichtigung des Ziels und Zwecks der Lizenz am besten miteinander in Einklang bringt. (2) Der Lizenzrat der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz kann mit verbindlicher Wirkung neue Versionen der Lizenz in Kraft setzen, soweit dies erforderlich und zumutbar ist. Neue Versionen der Lizenz werden auf der Internetseite http://www.d-fsl.de mit einer eindeutigen Versionsnummer veröffentlicht. Die neue Version der Lizenz erlangt für Sie verbindliche Wirkung, wenn Sie von deren Veröffentlichung Kenntnis genommen haben. Gesetzliche Rechtsbehelfe gegen die Änderung der Lizenz werden durch die vorstehenden Bestimmungen nicht beschränkt. (3) Sie dürfen diese Lizenz in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. § 10 Anwendbares Recht Auf diese Lizenz findet deutsches Recht Anwendung. Anhang: Wie unterstellen Sie ein Programm der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz? Um jedermann den Abschluss dieser Lizenz zu ermöglichen, wird empfohlen, das Programm mit folgendem Hinweis auf die Lizenz zu versehen: "Copyright (C) 20[jj] [Name des Rechtsinhabers]. Dieses Programm kann durch jedermann gemäß den Bestimmungen der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz genutzt werden. Die Lizenz kann unter http://www.d-fsl.de abgerufen werden."',
